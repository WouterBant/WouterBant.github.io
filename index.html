                The most beautiful and complex thing we know that has been created in the universe is (human) life.
                For more beauty and complexity to arise it is necessary that human life survives.
                For this spacecrafts are required. Well, there are also papers suggesting we could use free-floating planets
                 (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/migrating-extraterrestrial-civilizations-and-interstellar-colonization-implications-for-seti-and-seta/BFFC1BB63FED869C85172BB3CC88DBBB" target="_blank">Migrating extraterrestrial civilizations and interstellar colonization: implications for SETI and SETA</a>), 
                however, I think that humans should not limit ourselves to visiting places we can go via available free-floating planets,
                and then you need spacecrafts. There are many possible threats to human life,
                such as nuclear wars or climate change and if humans are able to survive the next 5.5 billion years the sun will vaporize the earth,
                 making human life on earth impossible. So, in order to increase the chances of human survival in the coming 5.5 billion years,
                 it is necessary for human life to be on multiple planets.
                 After that, we have to explore other solar systems with habitable conditions for humans.
                 The only way we can do this, with our current understanding of physics, is by moving through space in spacecrafts.

                On this website, the similarities between spacecrafts and the history are outlined.
                In specific I will look at the similarities in the (dynamics of) the origin spacecrafts and the history of the material world, life,
                and humanity.
