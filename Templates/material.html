                A big part of the development of the earth as we know has to do with the development of the moon. There are different theories about how the moon originated. One of these is the fission theory, which states that the moon formed out of the earth. This would have happened when the earth was hit by an object so massive that the earth split up into 1 large part and a lot of smaller parts which later formed the moon. This hypothesis is supported by the Apollo missions, which brought back materials containing very similar oxygen isotopes as we have on earth. However, there is also a theory that states that the earth and moon co-formated, so at the same time and close to each other. If this theory is correct the moon still had a huge role in the development of the earth. All the craters we see on the moon are from meteorites which if the moon was not there likely would have impacted earth.

            <p>
                A connection that focuses on the development of the earth and moon: The Apollo missions (missions that were not possible without spacecrafts) made it possible to develop hypotheses on how the moon and earth developed a very long time ago. Also, other missions such as ones to measure the seismic activity on the moon can help us understand the development of the earth which is tied to the development of the earth.

                A connection that focuses on the development of spacecrafts: If the moon never developed the earth of course would have looked very different, but it is also likely, I think, our spacecrafts would not have been as sophisticated as they are today. Because the main reason that we developed spacecrafts that can carry humans, was to bring humans to the moon. I do not think that there would have been a space race to Venus which has the closest approach to earth (
                    <a href="https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/pt.6.3.20190312a/full/?cookieSet=1#:~:text=Calculations%20and%20simulations%20confirm%20that,planet%20in%20the%20solar%20system" target="_blank">Stockman et. al. (2019)</a>
                ). The reason for this is that such a trip would take a long time and would be extremely expensive, a lot more expensive than the already expensive trip to the moon.Â

            <p>
                I mainly want to focus on the first connection and see what we have learned about the origin of the moon and the earth from lunar missions. To answer this question, this article looks interesting since it not only focuses on the materials brought back by the apollo missions but for example also looks at seismic experiments on the moon.
            </p>
            <p>
                To focus on the second connection, I have to know more about the motives for going to the moon. I will investigate this for my connection with the development of life on earth. If I can find enough information on this, I will also try to answer the question: If there was no moon but all other things would have been the same, would there have been a space race to Venus (or another planet)?
