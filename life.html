              If you take a look at early complex life, this was life with skeletons and shells, you see they emerged as a result of predators, so out of danger. In a very similar way, you have great technological advances during periods of danger on earth. This is done for protection, but also to show how powerful a nation is. One of these periods of danger on earth was the cold war, which was a period of tension between The United States and The Soviet Union. These two countries were battling with each other on many levels such as chess, and the development of (nuclear) weapons but also to get the first person to the moon. This last battle was won by The United States, but the importance for the connection is that that danger has led to the development of life on earth and also the development of the first spacecraft that was able to take humans to the moon (and back).
              I would like to investigate if it is likely that humans would have been on the moon without the cold war. The reason for this is that we have seen all kinds of technological advances in the last 30 years such as mobile phones, laptops, and computers which allow almost everyone on earth to find the information they want to know within a few seconds. But also programming languages that are way easier to use than Assembly Language which was used for the software of Apollo 11. Despite all of this, the last time a human went to the moon will be 30 years ago on 19 December and at this point, it does not seem like anyone will go there soon.

              If there would not have been a cold war it is likely that both The US and The SU would have had different presidents, so I want to limit myself to whether it is possible and likely that with normal technological advances in the area of spacecrafts, humans would have been on the moon by now. To answer this question properly I also have to find out why there has not been a human on the moon.
