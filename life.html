            <p>How early life exactly developed is unknown. However, it is a generally accepted idea that there were emerging single cells equipped with sensors, which would have been able to detect food (<a href="http://www.bighistory.info/" target="_blank">Spier, chapter 5, 2015</a>). Later, these single cells would have been equipped with little tails which allowed them to move to food. These sensors and tails heavily increased survival probabilities, and this led to a process of non-random elimination. Causing a larger proportion of living organisms to have these sensors and tails. It is likely that when multicellular organisms developed some of them developed very simple brains and eyes (<a href="http://www.bighistory.info/" target="_blank">Spier, chapter 5, 2015</a>). Also, this led to a process of non-random elimination.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>543 million years ago at the end of the Ediacaran period, life on Earth was still rather simple. Life forms in this period were probably immobile, soft-bodied, and fed themselves with nutrients through their skin (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-sparked-the-cambrian-explosion1/" target="_blank">Fox, 2016</a>). Also, oceans contained so little oxygen that fish alive today would die in them. Oxygen is also needed for the emergence of predators, so these also did not exist yet.</p>
            
            <p>All this changed approximately 540 million years ago with the Cambrian explosion (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion" target="_blank">Cambrian Explosion, Wikipedia</a>). We cannot be completely certain about what caused these changes, because we do not know a lot about the composition of the environment at that time. Some scientists think that during this period oxygen levels began to rise (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-sparked-the-cambrian-explosion1/" target="_blank">Fox, 2016</a>). These higher oxygen levels allow predators to emerge. The emergence of predators caused an arms race which led to the emergence of animals with better sensors, to spot danger, shields, and skeletons, for better protection and limbs that would make it easier for the animal to move (<a href="http://www.bighistory.info/" target="_blank">Spier, chapter 5, 2015</a>). The animals that did not develop these more complex features would be driven to extinction.</p>
            
            <p>So in the whole development of early life, you see clearly the effect of danger. Organisms that get attributes that allow them to survive will reproduce and give these attributes to the next generation. Until the Cambrian explosion, the development of life went pretty slow but as soon as danger emerged, in the form of predators, the complexity of life forms increased drastically. F. Spier called this in his book&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bighistory.info/" target="_blank">Big History and the Future of Humanity</a> on page 158: &ldquo;an arms race within and among species&rdquo;.</p>
            
            <p>Although spacecrafts are very different from life their development has great similarities with the development of life during the Cambrian explosion. The common factor: danger.</p>
            
            <p>A period full of danger on earth was the cold war, which was a period of tension between the US and the USSR that could have escalated to a third world war. In this period these countries were battling with each other in many areas such as chess and the development of (nuclear) weapons and spacecrafts. Developments were made for protection but also to show how powerful the nation is.</p>
            
            <p>The space race started in 1955, the year in which the US announced they will send a satellite to space. However, it was the USSR that launched the first Earth-orbiting satellite (Sputnik 1) and launched the first living organism into space, namely a dog, with Sputnik 2 &nbsp;in 1957 (<a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/space-race-timeline" target="_blank">Space Race Timeline</a>). This was done in a response to the announcement in 1955. In its turn, the US responded with Explorer 1 also an Earth-orbiting satellite, and by drastically increasing its funding for research and technology (<a href="https://physicstoday-scitation-org.proxy.uba.uva.nl/doi/10.1063/1.2754603" target="_blank">Rigden, 2007</a>). In the following years, the two countries send more satellites into space. It was mainly the USSR that achieved more notable things: Luna 2 reached the surface of the moon, and Luna 3 photographed the moon while orbiting around it (<a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/space-race-timeline" target="_blank">Space Race Timeline</a>). Also in 1961, with Vostok 1 Yuri Gagarin orbits the Earth, becoming the first human that has been in space (<a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/space-race-timeline" target="_blank">Space Race Timeline</a>).</p>
            
            <p>In response to this, former US president John F. Kennedy held his famous &lsquo;We Choose to go to the Moon&apos; speech at Rice University in 1962 in which he said the following: &quot;And this will be done in the decade of the 60s. It may be done while some of you are still here at school at this college and university. It will be done during the term of office of some of the people who sit here on this platform. But it will be done. And it will be done before the end of this decade.&quot; (<a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/why-did-we-stop-going-moon" target="_blank">Why did we stop going to the moon</a>). There were some great achievements on both sides in the following years. The USSR was able to return humans to Earth after being 3 days in space and the US satellite Mariner 4 returned images taken close from the planet Mars (<a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/space-race-timeline" target="_blank">Space Race Timeline</a>). But in 1969, over 700 million people saw live on television the promise of Kennedy being fulfilled when 2 out of the 3 crewmembers of Apollo 11 walked on the moon.</p>
            
            <p>Technological and research-based missions were never as important as winning the battle of going to the moon (<a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/why-did-we-stop-going-moon" target="_blank">Why did we stop going to the moon</a>). It was a contest of political ideologies and technological progress between the US and the USSR so only 3 years after the goal of putting an American on the moon was accomplished, the Apollo program was canceled because of the astronomical expenses (<a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/why-did-we-stop-going-moon" target="_blank">Why did we stop going to the moon</a>). In 1975 the tensions between the US and the USSR were way less and they launched a cooperative mission: Apollo-Soyuz (<a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/space-race-timeline" target="_blank">Space Race Timeline</a>). And after that, no one has been on the moon. This all clearly shows that there were massive technological advancements in spacecrafts because of the competition that arose because of the tension created in the dangerous period, known as the Cold War.</p>
            
            <p>In conclusion, if you take a look at early complex life, this was life with skeletons and shells, you see they emerged as a result of predators, so out of danger. In a very similar way, you see great technological advances in spacecrafts during the Cold War, a period full of danger. It is only speculation but I think that without this period of danger, it is unlikely that any human would have been on the moon. The main reason for me writing this is that, as I outlined above, all the advancements were made in response to achievements by the other country. I also think that without this period of danger, no president of any country would have spent the amount of money the US spent. Only the Apollo program cost 28 billion dollars, today equivalent to approximately 300 billion dollars (<a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/cost-of-apollo#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20spent%20%2425.8,for%20inflation%20to%202020%20dollars" target="_blank">Costs Apollo program</a>). My speculation is also supported by the fact that over the past 50 years no human has been on the moon even though, we have seen all kinds of technological advances that would make it easier to go to the moon. Similarly, I think that without the emergence of predators, life on Earth would be far less complex. So, it seems like the space race and the &ldquo;arms race within and among species&rdquo; are not that different.</p>
